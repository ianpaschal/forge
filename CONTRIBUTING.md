## Recommended setup:



Conforming to style



Getting the recommended dev environment

    Install Visual Studio Code
        Visual Studio Code has nothing to do with Visual Studio!
        It's (cross-platform + JS-based + rich plugin ecosystem) like Atom, only implemented better.
        Yes it's actually cool, because Microsoft has started to be cool.
    Install the RustyCode Extension and its dependencies
    Make sure to set up "rust.cargoHomePath", "rust.racerPath" and "rust.rustLangSrcPath" in the VS Code settings
    For debugging (Linux/MacOS): Install the LLDB Debugger Extension
    Now everything should just work, since configuration is part of the repo in .vscode! (fingers crossed)

State of the code & organization

The code is in a pretty messy state after a rushed first release, but will become much more modular and well-documented over time. Issues are categorized into levels of difficulty amongst other properties, but the ones flagged with "Assistance Welcome" are most likely to be tackleable by outside contributors. Pull requests of any kind are welcome, but there is no defined process or acceptance criteria yet, we'll just figure it out along the way.
